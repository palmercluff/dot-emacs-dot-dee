My personal .emacs.d

This repository is 2-fold:
  - To provide myself a backup of my current .emacs.d settings without having to rely on an internet connection to download external packages
  - To provide anyone else with ideas and suggestions that are looking to expand their own .emacs.d

Note that if you are not running Emacs off of a Micorsoft Windows PC, you can remove the `windows_binaries` folder from this directory.
