Known bugs/issues:

* ditaa is too slow, possibly due to the excessive number of calls to fill
  functions.
* There are certain diagrams which are not rendered correctly, see
  tests/text/ditaa_bug.txt and tests/text/ditaa_bug2.txt

Planned features:

* Support for custom shapes which can be loaded from SVG or PNG files (almost
  done, testing pending).
* Javadoc taglet will be integrated into ditaa (written by Mikael Brännström)
* Limited-features EPS output (written by Mikael Brännström)
* Possible LaTeX filter similar to the HTML filter.
